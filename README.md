# Homework 2

_A project by Sam Higgins_

This is an Expo project that helps you keep track of items and tasks you still need to do.

### How do I use it?

After downloading this repo, you'll run

```
npx create-expo-app to-do-list --template blank
```

in the directory above the project folder, which installs the necessary tools to then run

```
expo start
```
